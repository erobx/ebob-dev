            I'm a current Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I love spending time typing, watching sports, and working out.
            As someone who as always been passionate about technology and its potential to transform the world, I feel incredibly fortunate to be pursuing my degree
            in such an exciting and dynamic field. I enjoy keeping up with recent tech news by browsing forums such as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and
            <a href="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</a>.
