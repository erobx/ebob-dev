        <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I love
            spending time typing, watching sports, and working out. As someone
            who has always been passionate about technology and its potential to
            transform the world, I feel incredibly fortunate to be pursuing my
            degree in such an exciting and dynamic field. I enjoy keeping up
            with recent tech news by browsing forums such as <a class="hover:underline"
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a
            >.
