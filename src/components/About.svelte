        <p class="text-[#9E9F90]">
            I'm a newly graduated computer science student from the University of Florida. I love
            spending time typing, watching baseball, and working out. As someone
            who has always been passionate about technology and its potential to
            transform the world, I feel incredibly fortunate to be pursuing my
            career in such an exciting and dynamic field. I enjoy keeping up
            with recent tech news by browsing forums such as <a class="hover:underline"
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a
            >.

            Currently, I am looking for Entry Level Developer positions.
            For all inquiries, please email me at <b>erob7856@gmail.com</b>.
            I have experience working on an established NextJS + NodeJS code base, as well as
            interfacing with PostgresSQL. Right now, I am building a
            <a class="hover:underline" href="https://github.com/erobx/tradeups">fullstack application</a>
            using ReactJS + Golang + PostgresSQL focusing on group tradeups from the
            popular game CS2.

            I grew up playing educational CD games on an old Dell tower with Windows XP.
            I enjoyed solving math equations, logic puzzles, and word games each game
            threw at me. Once I reached high school, I knew I wanted to continue on this
            path and computer science caught my attention. I love tinkering with computers
            and diving deep into different crevices of operating systems trying to broaden
            my knowledge. One day I hope to have my own servers and home network where
            I have full creative freedom.
