        <p>
            I'm a computer science student at the University of Florida. I love
            spending time typing, watching sports, and working out. As someone
            who has always been passionate about technology and its potential to
            transform the world, I feel incredibly fortunate to be pursuing my
            degree in such an exciting and dynamic field. I enjoy keeping up
            with recent tech news by browsing forums such as <a class="hover:underline"
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a
            >.

            I grew up playing educational CD games on an old Dell tower with Windows XP.
            I enjoyed solving math equations, logic puzzles, and word games each game
            threw at me. Once I reached high school, I knew I wanted to continue on this
            path and computer science caught my attention. I love tinkering with computers
            and diving deep into different crevices of operating systems trying to broaden
            my knowledge. One day I hope to have my own servers and home network where
            I have full creative freedom.

            I credit my passion to my parents for giving me this oportunity. Thank you.
